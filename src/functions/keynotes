Chapter 11 - Functions

About functions:
  Arguments are passed by assignment (object reference)
    
  global declares module-level variables that are to be assigned.
    With global, we can do an assignment to a module level instead to a function level
 
  Arguments, return values, and variables are not declared.
    

Structure:
  def <name>(arg1, arg2,... argN):
    <statements>

=============================================================
def in runtime:
  def executes in run time, it can be run from any part of a module


using this schema can amplify our polymorphism scope to any project using a multicase functional function (lol)
